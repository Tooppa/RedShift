  note: "We are supposed to live forever in these suits that could malfunction or
    be punctured at any moment. We only have those strange pressurized sleeping pods
    which are cramped and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nWe have to dig samples, analyze them
    and setup those fancy machines that cost more than this planet. But there isn\u2019t
    anything for us. Every nickle is spent on new spaceships or something. We just
    have to work! We just have to work for nothing.\r\n\r\nJane, Worker"
