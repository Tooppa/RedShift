  note: "Congratulations!\r\n\r\nYour continuous efforts to improve the society has
    been noted. Because of your work you have been promoted to citizen-C (class c
    citizen).\r\n\r\nYour identification on your chip will have to be updated. The
    process will take approximately 40-70 atus (astronomical time unit) to complete
    depending on local environmental conditions and traffic. Make sure that you are
    in the functional range of a pylon at all times before the process has been completed.
    A non up to date identification cannot be used to access any kind of service
    of your upcoming status.\r\n\r\nYou have been assigned to be exported from P>V>Q3
    to S>1. Your shuttle\u2019s tracking code will be available when the promotion
    has been completed. Failing to board your designated shuttle will result in relocation
    procedures and you will be assigned to a temporary role.\r\n\r\nIf you have any
    questions, please contact your local supervisor."
