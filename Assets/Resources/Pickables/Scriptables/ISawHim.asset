  note: "You heard the bang right? It\u2019s never a good sign. I was at the surface
    taking a look at the stars because you can only see them rarely. Then I saw him.
    Morgan was outside the barrier carrying something on a drone. Looked like a body.\r\n\r\nIt
    must have been Jane. I haven\u2019t found her anywhere. I tried to look where
    he was going but he disappeared after the dunes. It won\u2019t stop here. He
    must be planning something.\r\n\r\nOliver, Worker"
