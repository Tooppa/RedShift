  note: "What the hell are you doing? Over half of the boring machines have broken
    in just two days. Do you think that I am stupid? If I would follow the protocol,
    there would be none of you left by now. I am at my limit and I cannot keep them
    out of this for any longer.\r\n\r\nJust fix the machines and live your lives.
    That is all I\u2019m asking.\r\n\r\nMorgan, Chief Operating Officer"
