  note: "Guys, come to the lobby. This week\u2019s shipment was BIG. They sent a
    heavy-duty drone. Imagine! We could carry some of our metals with it and we wouldn\u2019t
    have to rely so much on the crazy ass elevator. Let\u2019s have a talk with Morgan.
    He will surely agree.\r\n\r\nThey also sent a heat radiator with beaming capabilites.
    The range should be enough. With this, we could use those lighter suits at night
    which are much more comfortable.\r\n\r\nOliver, Worker"
