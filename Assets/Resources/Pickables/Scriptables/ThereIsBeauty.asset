  note: "There is really nothing here. Dry desert, unforgiving temperatures, toxic
    athmosphere. You would surely call me crazy but I actually like it here. One
    day Morgan let me accompany him outside the barrier. Rode an old kind of vehicle,
    those with wheels, you know.\r\n\r\nIt was beautiful. I was free. The endless
    flow of sand and the radiance of the two suns. I saw the look in his eyes. It
    isn\u2019t much but this planet is our home.\r\n\r\nRonald, Worker"
