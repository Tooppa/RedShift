  note: "It\u2019s too late now. I received code red just now. You know what this
    means. Out of respect, I will give you 20 minutes. Hug each other, say goodbye
    or something. \r\n\r\nWhy did this happen? I thought that we were friends. I
    tried everything I could to try to understand you and to just live together.
    But you always acted like I was the bad guy. What did I do wrong? Was I unclear
    about the situation?\r\n\r\nMorgan, Chief Operating Officer\r\n"
