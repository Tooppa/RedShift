  note: "Environmental conditions like temperature will force us to use appropriate
    equipment. It\u2019s the same with roads, structures and nature. Just pick what\u2019s
    safe to use.\r\n\r\nBut this place is worse. You are forced to do fatal mistakes
    by climbing these ridiculous man made cliffs. You are supposed to make the same
    jump over and over again. But what if you won\u2019t make it next time? What
    if you slip or you are tired? It\u2019s just it, a goodbye.\r\n\r\nJane, Worker"
