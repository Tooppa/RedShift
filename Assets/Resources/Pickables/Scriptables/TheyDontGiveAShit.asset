  note: "Seriously guys, this doesn\u2019t lead anywhere! Rebelling will accomplish
    nothing. They don\u2019t give a shit about you or me or anyone. If you keep giving
    them reasons, we will all die. They will just sweep us out and then they just
    replace the crew next week. There is nothing that you can do about it.\r\n\r\nJane,
    come to my office ASAP. Let\u2019s work this out. We can still fix this.\r\n\r\nMorgan,
    Chief Operating Officer"
